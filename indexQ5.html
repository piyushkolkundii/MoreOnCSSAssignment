    <h4>Information about Google Fonts</h4>
    <p>Google Fonts aren't limited to the web. You can download and use them locally in apps like Microsoft Word. We'll show you how to download and use these fonts on both Windows and Mac computers. First, download the font or fonts that you want to use in your documents from the Google Fonts Library. 
    With over 1,500 font families available, Google Fonts has become the go-to font library for many designers and small business owners. The library has a wide selection of serif and sans serif fonts, as well as script fonts, slab serifs, display typefaces, and handwritten fonts. 
    <br>Technically speaking, Google fonts are not traditional web-safe web fonts. Web-safe fonts are a set of web fonts that are commonly installed and supported by default across many different operating systems and devices which is why they are sometimes called system fonts.
    The Font List Is Long â€“ Because the Google Font list has over 1,300 fonts, it may take a while for all the fonts to load correctly especially if you have a slow internet connection.
